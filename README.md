##Logs

### Day 0: February 1, 2017
1) **enemy_generator:** It can create enemy ship as the EnemyshipFactory's object is created which has gamers level as argument to creat enemy of his game level. It uses factory pattern to do so and enemy ship is created at runtime. Desired common properties of enemy can be added in the Enemyship abstract class which is inherited to create enemy by passing appropriate parameters.

 6) **letter_count:** It can count the no of times a letter is used in the array of strings supplied.

### Day 5: February 6,2017
 7) **array_flattener:** It converts multi-dimensional array to one-dimensional array by concatination of array returned from recursion in multi-dimensional array.

### Day 6: 19 Sep 2017
 8) **two sum:** Given an array of integers, return indixes of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Day 7:
 9) **log processor:** prints the number of errors and warnings as per the date in the log.

### Day 8:
 10) **common elements:** Prints the number of common elements in two given array.
